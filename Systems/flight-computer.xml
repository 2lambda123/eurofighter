flight computer i/o
not sure exactly what this is going to look like 100% yet...
but all native flightgear properties (speed, heading, etc) should be filtered
through this file before going to the instruments. we shouldn't always have
direct tie ins between native fg properties and the instruments themselves
(despite what the forums say :P)
