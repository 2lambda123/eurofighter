other than fuel tank amounts, most of this info is a best guess.
fuel tank amounts have been closely estimated based upon the mfd screen

tank list:
0 - fore tank - 2028
1 - mid tank - 2095
2 - aft tank - 1962
3 - foreleft wing tank - 1080
4 - aftleft wing tank - 1080
5 - foreright wing tank - 1080
6 - aftright wing tank - 1080
7 - center drop tank
8 - left drop tank
9 - right drop tank
10 - left accumulator - 2
11 - right accumulator - 2

<!--
	logic:
	mid boosts to left acc (lpcock according)
	aft boosts to right acc (lpcock according)

	center tank pressures into mid
	wing drop pressures into wing fore
	wing fore pressures into wing aft

	fore pressures into aft, then - 
	wing aft pressures into aft

	refuel feeds fore and aft
	transfer fuel for cg shift happens between aft wings and fore
